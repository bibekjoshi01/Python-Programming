GIL: Global Interpreter Lock
- A lock that allows only one thread at a time to execute in python.
- Needed in CPython because memory management is not thread-safe

- Avoid:
    - Use multiprocessing
    - Use a different, free-threaded python implementation (Jython, IronPython)
    - use Python as a wrapper for third-party libraries (C/C++) -> numpy, scipy
