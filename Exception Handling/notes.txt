1. Use try-except-finally blocks to handle exceptions gracefully 
    and ensure your code can handle errors effectively.

2. Catch specific exceptions rather than using a catch-all except block 
    to avoid swallowing unexpected exceptions and make it easier to identify and fix issues.

3. Consider raising custom exceptions when appropriate to provide more informative error messages to users.

4. Avoid common pitfalls, such as using overly broad exception handling or 
    ignoring important exceptions, to ensure your code remains robust and reliable.

5. Embrace logging as a powerful tool for monitoring and debugging your applications, 
and learn to log exceptions and errors effectively to aid in troubleshooting.

6. Apply exception handling to real-world scenarios, such as handling API errors 
    or file I/O exceptions, to gain practical experience and enhance your skills.
